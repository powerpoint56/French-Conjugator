# French-Conjugator
This project is an ad-hoc browser version of a C++ program I made. Due to the hasty implementation, some bad design needs to be ameliorated (see [issues](../../issues)). Once I resolve those issues I will document how to use conjugator.js in your project.

# Installation
    $ git clone https://github.com/powerpoint56/French-Conjugator
